## Problems Faced

One thing I would do better next time is use the functions to generate the license based on just picking MIT, Eclipse, etc. I was having a hard time with that so I just hardcoded the answers, hence why it looks a little funky. I let the word in front of the license to make it easier for the user to choose a license in the command line.
